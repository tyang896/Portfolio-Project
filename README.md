# Portfolio 

## Description
This is not a complete portfolio and the purpose of this project was to practice creating a portfolio page using advanced CSS skills. This is still a work in progress and I plan on adding more additions and improvents later on. In order to get a good start, I've added different sections, images and links to the webpage. More links will be added to the portfolio in the future.

One of the most challenging parts of this practice was paying attention to the placement of my code and understanding the parent-child relationships. I've learned that the order that you place your css code matters and it's important to understand how they interact with one another. I plan on doing more practice with CSS parent-child relationships in order to improve this webpage in the future.
